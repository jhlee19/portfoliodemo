            Florence Lee
          </h1>

          <p>
            Florence Lee is a BFA1 student of California Institute of the Arts,
            majoring in Fine Arts. She is from South Korea, and I have nothing
            more to say but this is suppose to be my artist biography. Her
            favorite medium is oil paint, acrylic, color pencils, and graphite.
            She also has experience in dancing and cheerleading. If you want to
